# Introduction

A simple REST API with an endpoint that calculates the taxes and performs currency exchange for invoices. The endpoint takes three inputs: Invoice Date, Invoice Pre-Tax Amount in Euro (EUR), and Payment Currency. After completing currency calculations, the endpoint returns four outputs: Pre-Tax Amount, Tax Amount, Grand Total, and Exchange Rate.

Only two currencies are supported for currency conversion: Canadian Dollar (CAD) and US Dollar (USD).
